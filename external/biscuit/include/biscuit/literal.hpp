/**
 * A Literal is a representation of a constant value that can be loaded into a register.
 * This is useful for avoiding multiple instructions for loading big constants.
 *
 * Literals, like Labels, don't need to be placed immediately. They can be created
 * and used with loads that require a Literal, and placed in the buffer at a later point.
 *
 * @note Any literal that is created, is used with a load instruction,
 *       but is *not* placed to a location (via Place() in the assembler)
 *       will result in an assertion being invoked when the literal instance's
 *       destructor is executed.
 *
 * @note A literal may only be placed to one location. Any attempt to place
 *       a literal that is already placed will result in an assertion being
 *       invoked.
 *
 * @par
 * An example of placing a literal:
 * @code{.cpp}
 * Assembler as{...};
 * Literal literal(0x1234567890ABCDEF);
 *
 * as.LD(x2, &literal);     // Load the literal (emits a AUIPC+LD sequence)
 * as.JR(x2);               // Execution continues elsewhere
 * as.Place(&literal);      // Place the literal at this location in the buffer
 * @endcode
