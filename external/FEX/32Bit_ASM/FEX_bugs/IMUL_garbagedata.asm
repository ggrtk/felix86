bits 32

; FEX had a bug where smaller than 64-bit imul could leave garbage data in the upper 32-bits of the 32-bit result.
; This would cause subsequent instructions after the imul to receive garbage bits.
; In particular this would feed in to address calculation in DXVK with "Dungeon Defenders" doing address calculation.
; The address calculation did something similar to:
;   xor edx, edx
;   mov eax, 0x7dbf2800
;   imul ebx, ebx, 0xaaaaaaab
;   div ebx
; Divide expected 0x4f but received 0xffffffb1'0000'004f

; Dividend
xor edx, edx
mov eax, 0x7dbf2800

; Multiply starting value
mov ebx, 0xED

; imul 2-src 8-bit check
