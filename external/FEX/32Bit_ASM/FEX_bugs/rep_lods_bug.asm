; FEX had a bug that only manifests in 32-bit mode around pushing and popping flags around rep lobs{b,w,d,q}
; This manifested as a corrupt CF and ZF flag even though rep lodsb isn't supposed to affect flags.
; Test this by first storing zero to eflags, doing the operation and then loading it back.
