Questions and answers about JIT design in case I forget why I did something or someone wonders.

# Why load/store the entire state in the dispatcher instead of loading the regs you read and storing the regs you modify OR why not only writeback volatile registers on C function calls
Because of guest asynchronous signals. They can happen at any moment. While we are in JIT, the host registers hold the correct guest register values. While we are outside the JIT (dispatcher, C++ code, ...) then the ThreadState holds the correct values.

Technically you could extract just the modified registers if a signal happens in JIT code, which was our previous implementation. However then I would ask you how you'd do the same once you start worrying about a multiple block JIT that writebacks only at the end. Additionally, that requires decoding the instructions from the start of the block until the PC, which means you need a decoder (and the RISC-V decoder options are very lacking). Also in general I think it's clunky. Loading/storing the entire state on entry/exit is the way to go.
