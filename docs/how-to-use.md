# How to use

:warning: felix86 is early in development. It can run some simple games. :warning:

## Required architecture
You need a RISC-V board with `rv64gvb` extensions.

Furthermore, **you need a recent version of Linux like `6.11`**, so that there is vector extension support in signal handlers.
If you don't have a recent version of Linux, things may go wrong.

Any extra extensions might be utilized, but `G` and `V` are mandatory.
`B` is currently mandatory. Eventually it won't be, but currently it is.

felix86 is going to tell you which extensions it detects on your system.
If you have an extension but it's unable to detect it, you can use the environment variable:
```
FELIX86_ALL_EXTENSIONS=g,c,v,b
```
to specify all available extensions.

## Using on RISC-V hardware

Simply compile felix86 with CMake

Run these from the base directory of felix86:
```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
```

Make sure to [grab a RootFS](#rootfs) and then felix86 is ready to run!

## QEMU

This works fine for me: (change the cores/RAM to your liking)
Make sure the disk image has enough space to compile.
```bash
qemu-system-riscv64 \
-machine virt -m 8192 -smp 10 \
-cpu rv64,v=true,vlen=128,vext_spec=v1.0,zacas=true,zabha=true,zba=true,zbb=true,zbc=true,zbs=true \
-bios /usr/share/qemu/opensbi-riscv64-generic-fw_dynamic.bin \
-kernel /usr/share/u-boot-qemu-bin/qemu-riscv64_smode/uboot.elf \
-device virtio-net-device,netdev=eth0 -netdev user,id=eth0 \
-device virtio-rng-pci \
-drive file=ubuntu-24.04.1-preinstalled-server-riscv64.img,format=raw,if=virtio
```

## RootFS

felix86 requires an x86-64 "rootfs" which is the filesystem at the root directory on Linux.

The way to get the rootfs varies for each distro, for Ubuntu you can use the following link:
- [http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-base/releases/](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-base/releases/)

After acquiring the rootfs, you need to supply felix86 with the path to the rootfs directory using the `-L` parameter.

After providing the path you can add more optional arguments and finish it with the path to the binary you want to emulate and
any arguments you want to pass.

The binary **must** be inside the rootfs directory, so place it anywhere in there.

Example:
`./felix86 -L /home/myuser/myrootfs /home/myuser/myrootfs/MyApplication arg1 arg2 arg3`

Or, don't prepend the executable path with the rootfs path:
`./felix86 -L /home/myuser/myrootfs /MyApplication arg1 arg2 arg3`

You may also set the `FELIX86_ROOTFS` environment variable to point to the path so you don't have to type it every time.

By default, the host environment variables are passed to the executable.

If an executable makes frequent use of the console, you may want to disable felix86's logging via the `-q` flag, or redirect it to a file via the `FELIX86_LOG_FILE` environment variable.

Use `--help` to view all the options.

## Compiling tests

Set `BUILD_TESTS` to 1/ON/whatever CMake recognizes as truthy.

Run `felix86_test` to run every test, or `felix86_test "the test name"` to run a specific test.

Also try `felix86_test --help`, it uses Catch2.

## Specifying available extensions
felix86 will use Linux's riscv_hwprobe syscall to try to find the available RISC-V extensions.

There are cases where you might want to override which extensions are available entirely. For example, if your board has `g,c,v,zicond` you might want felix86 to only use the `g,c,v` extensions. Or you might want to specify that you have `XTheadCondMov`, which is undetectable via that syscall. This can be achieved with either the command line option `--all-extensions` or the environment variable `FELIX86_ALL_EXTENSIONS`.

If you want to only add new extensions instead of overriding them, use the environment variable `FELIX86_EXTENSIONS`

felix86 requires `g` and `v` with vlen of at least 128.
